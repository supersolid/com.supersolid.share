# Unity Native Share Plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a fork from an asset no longer maintained! While using this package, expect issues when sharing a file/image/video with a text (see FAQ). Find the base repository in: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare

## INSTALLATION

- *Package Manager* > **add package from Git URL**:
  - `https://github.com/supersolid/com.supersolid.share.git`

### iOS Setup

There are two ways to set up the plugin on iOS:

- **a. Automated Setup:** *(optional)* change the value of **Photo Library Usage Description** at *Project Settings/yasirkula/Native Share*
- **b. Manual Setup:** see: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/wiki/Manual-Setup-for-iOS

## HOW TO

Simply create a new **NativeShare** object and customize it by chaining the following functions as you like (see example code):

- `Clear()`: clears the previously set share content (if any). Only useful if the same NativeShare instance will be reused for memory efficiency
- `SetSubject( string subject )`: sets the subject (primarily used in e-mail applications)
- `SetText( string text )`: sets the shared text. Note that the Facebook app will omit text, if exists (see [this topic](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35102802/2373034))
- `SetUrl( string url )`: sets the shared url. On supported iOS apps, this url is used to generate a preview of the target webpage. Other iOS apps may append the url to the text or omit it. While sharing a file on iOS or while sharing anything on Android, the url is appended to the text (unless the text already contains the url)
- `AddFile( string filePath, string mime = null )`: adds the file at path to the share action. You can add multiple files of different types. The MIME of the file is automatically determined if left null; however, if the file doesn't have an extension and/or you already know the MIME of the file, you can enter the MIME manually. MIME has no effect on iOS
- `AddFile( Texture2D texture, string createdFileName = "Image.png" )`: saves the *texture* to *Application.temporaryCachePath* with the specified filename and adds the image file to the share action
- `AddEmailRecipient( string emailAddress )`: auto-populates the *recipients* field of e-mail applications on Android platform. Has no effect on iOS
- `SetTitle( string title )`: sets the title of the share dialog on Android platform. Has no effect on iOS
- `AddTarget( string androidPackageName, string androidClassName = null )`: shares content on a specific application on Android platform. If *androidClassName* is left null, list of activities in the share dialog will be narrowed down to the activities in the specified *androidPackageName* that can handle this share action. Note that androidClassName, if provided, must be the full name of the activity (with its package). You can call this function multiple times. This function has no effect on iOS
- `SetCallback( ShareResultCallback callback )`: invokes the *callback* function after the share action is completed. **ShareResultCallback** has the following signature: `void ShareResultCallback( ShareResult result, string shareTarget )`
  - `ShareResult result` can take 3 values:
    - **Unknown:** we can't determine whether or not the user has shared the content
    - **Shared:** user has probably shared the content. This value guarantees that the user has at least selected an app from the share sheet. But it is impossible to say whether the user has actually shared the content or cancelled the operation right after selecting the app from the share sheet
    - **NotShared:** either the user has closed the share sheet immediately or selected an app from the share sheet but then decided not to share the content (unfortunately, most apps return *Shared* for the latter case)
  - `string shareTarget` stores information about the app that the user has selected from the share sheet. It can be *null* or empty, if this information isn't provided. Usually, this is the package name/class name of the selected application. You can use this value to e.g. determine if the user has picked Twitter from the share sheet: `shareTarget != null && shareTarget.ToLowerInvariant().Contains( "twitter" )`

Finally, calling the **Share()** function of the NativeShare object will present the share sheet.

## UTILITY FUNCTIONS

- `bool NativeShare.TargetExists( string androidPackageName, string androidClassName = null )`: returns whether the application with the specified package/class name exists on the Android device. If *androidClassName* is left null, only the package name is queried. This function always returns true on iOS
- `bool FindTarget( out string androidPackageName, out string androidClassName, string packageNameRegex, string classNameRegex = null )`: finds the package/class name of an installed application on the Android device using regular expressions. Returns true if a matching package/class name is found successfully. Can be useful when you want to use the *AddTarget* function but don't know the exact package/class name of the target activity. If *classNameRegex* is left null, the first activity in the matching package is returned. This function always returns false on iOS

## FAQ

- **Can I share on a specific app?**

On Android, you can share on a specific app via *AddTarget*. For iOS, you can check out this post and see if it works for you: https://forum.unity.com/threads/native-share-for-android-ios-open-source.519865/page-4#post-4011874

- **I can't share image with text on X app**

It is just not possible to share an image/file with text/subject on some apps (e.g. Facebook), they intentionally omit either the image or the text from the shared content. These apps require you to use their own SDKs for complex share actions. For best compatibility, I'd recommend you to share either only image or only text.

- **I can't build the project to Android, it says "Android resource linking failed: unexpected element &lt;queries&gt; found in &lt;manifest&gt;" in the error message**

NativeShare adds `<queries>` element to AndroidManifest.xml due to the new [package visibility change](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility). The build error can be fixed by following these steps: [Android 11](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity-arf/android-11-build), [Android 12](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity-arf/android-12-build). In the worst case, if you are OK with NativeShare not working on some of the affected devices, then you can open *NativeShare.aar* with WinRAR or 7-Zip and then remove the `<queries>...</queries>` element from *AndroidManifest.xml*.

- **When using Unity as a Library on Android, the app crashes when sharing a file**

If you're running the Unity activity in a separate process, then modify *AndroidManifest.xml* inside *NativeShare.aar* so that both `NativeShareCustomShareDialogActivity` and `NativeShareBroadcastListener` also run on the same process, e.g:

```xml
<activity android:name=".NativeShareCustomShareDialogActivity" ... android:process=":YourProcess" />
<receiver android:name=".NativeShareBroadcastListener" ... android:process=":YourProcess" />
```

- **Can't share, it says "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.yasirkula.unity.NativeShare" in Logcat**

If you are sure that your plugin is up-to-date, then enable **Custom Proguard File** option from *Player Settings* and add the following line to that file: `-keep class com.yasirkula.unity.* { *; }`

- **Can't share when using Beebyte Obfuscator, it says "Exception: No such proxy method: xyz.HasManagedCallback()" in Logcat**

Add `NativeShareNamespace.NSShareResultCallbackAndroid` to the `Skip Classes` section of your obfuscator settings asset.

## EXAMPLE CODE

The following code captures the screenshot of the game whenever you tap the screen, saves it in a temporary path and then shares it:

```csharp
void Update()
{
	if( Input.GetMouseButtonDown( 0 ) )
		StartCoroutine( TakeScreenshotAndShare() );
}

private IEnumerator TakeScreenshotAndShare()
{
	yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame();

	Texture2D ss = new Texture2D( Screen.width, Screen.height, TextureFormat.RGB24, false );
	ss.ReadPixels( new Rect( 0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height ), 0, 0 );
	ss.Apply();

	string filePath = Path.Combine( Application.temporaryCachePath, "shared img.png" );
	File.WriteAllBytes( filePath, ss.EncodeToPNG() );

	// To avoid memory leaks
	Destroy( ss );

	new NativeShare().AddFile( filePath )
		.SetSubject( "Subject goes here" ).SetText( "Hello world!" ).SetUrl( "https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare" )
		.SetCallback( ( result, shareTarget ) => Debug.Log( "Share result: " + result + ", selected app: " + shareTarget ) )
		.Share();

	// Share on WhatsApp only, if installed (Android only)
	//if( NativeShare.TargetExists( "com.whatsapp" ) )
	//	new NativeShare().AddFile( filePath ).AddTarget( "com.whatsapp" ).Share();
}
```

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- Gif files are shared as static images on iOS (to learn more, please see this issue: https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeShare/issues/22)
